Rename
This is used to automatically rename music files.
What this project basically did was that it crawled the entire directory for files with mp3 extension and checked all the file names for common errors/extra words in them like a website link with the song title name and then remove them in one go.

Benefit: It saved a lot of time and the title looks clean

For example: abc(www.somesite.com).mp3 becomes--> abc.mp3
